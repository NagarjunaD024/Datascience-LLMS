### üöÄ What You'll Find Inside

This repository is structured to mirror the book's chapters, providing a clear path from fundamental techniques to advanced applications. Each notebook is a self-contained implementation of a key data analysis task.

| Chapter Focus | Key Projects / Notebooks | Core Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Foundational Skills** | `DataScience_GPT.ipynb` | Basic API setup, model interaction, prompt customization. |
| **Text Analysis** | `Classification.ipynb`<br>`Information_Extraction.ipynb`<br>`Clustering.ipynb` | Sentiment analysis, structured data extraction, and clustering with vector embeddings. |
| **Structured Data** | `Natural_Language_Query_Interface_RDBMS.ipynb`<br>`Natural_Language_Query_Interface_Cypher.ipynb` | Building natural language interfaces for SQL (RDBMS) and Cypher (Graph DBs). |
| **Multimodal Analysis**| `llama_extractingtext_multipleformats.ipynb` | Using LlamaIndex to query mixed-format documents (PDF, PPTX, TXT). |
| **Advanced Frameworks** | `langchain_classification.ipynb`<br>`langchain_agents.ipynb`<br>`langchain_sql_agents_withfunction.ipynb` | Refactoring with LangChain, building agents with multiple tools (SQL, Search), and creating custom agent tools. |
